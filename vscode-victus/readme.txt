I really like my day-to-day workstation. A HP Victus 16". Ryzen + RTX and massive RAM makes productive work faster and easier.
The german keyboard layout is a bit strange having the <> | keys different to where they are normally. That makes the coding life a bit harder with a lot of typos on the fly.

Shortcuts:
[Shift] [Shift] => "<"
[Ctrl] [< / oem_102] => "|"
