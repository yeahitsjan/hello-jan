## ``Hi, my name is Jan!``

And I do a lot of coding. Besides that, I always try to make my life a bit easier. Here you will find a selection of:
- Python scripts to help myself or friends
- Random keymaps for specific type of software (video editors, Blender, whatever..)
- Demos / benchmark to stress test various hardware components

Have fun!
